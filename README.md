# Spatial distribution of chaotic orbits, the Gauss Iterated Map and the Ergodic Theorem
“Nature is highly complex, and the only prediction you can make is that she is unpredictable.”[1] 
Chaos theory is captured the beauty of the unpredictable 
and display it in the most beautiful patterns. 
The application of chaos theory were diverse, such as earth’s weather system, 
the migratory patterns of birds, or the spread of vegetation across a continent. 
Many of the above application topics concern discrete dynamical systems, 
which are very different from the continuous dynamical systems. 
The project considers the feature of spatial distribution of chaotic orbits, the Gauss Iterated Map and the Ergodic Theorem.


•	The project studies the chaotic nature and the spatial distribution of the Gauss iterated map. 
One interesting point to consider is that given the same seed of two chaotic orbits which both follow some random patterns,
it is interesting to see how to distinguish these chaotic orbits. 

•	In mathematics, the Gauss map which is also known as Gaussian map or mouse map,
is a nonlinear iterated map of the reals into a real interval given by the Gaussian function. 
The function is named after Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss, and the function maps the bell shaped Gaussian function
similar to the logistic map. The project describes the definition and conducted 
an analysis on one specific example of the Gauss iterated map in our project. 
The project focuses on analyzing the chaotic nature and spatial distribution of F(x) on some interval I which F: I → I. 

•	The project also briefly introduces the Ergodic theorem as it is a part of the theory of dynamical systems. 
Focus is placed on discussing the relationship between time average and space average, 
as well as how it is related to finding the Lyapunov exponent using the invariant density function.
